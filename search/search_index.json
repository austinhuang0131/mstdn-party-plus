The current proposed wording is:</p> <p>In general, the use of alt text, in good faith, is required for any public post that contains media.</p> <p>By \"in good faith\" it means that the alt text should be intended to accurately describe the image; in other words, one may not \"cheat\" the rule by putting irrelevant content as alt text (for example: text solely intended for SEO, file names, etc.). The rule is not intended to introduce an explicit criteria on the quality of the alt text, though good practices are to be recommended.</p> <p>If the post content already describes the image, or if the image is a textual reiteration of parts of the post content (eg. it simply reiterates the title of the addressed subject), then the use of alt text is optional.</p> <p>The rule does not apply to posts with follower-only or mention-only visibilities. The rule is not to be actively enforced on replies, except those intended to reach a wider audience than solely the addressed.</p> <p>Exceptions to the rule can be considered in situations where compliance may introduce an undue burden, eg. in case of disability.

In some cases, accounts simply post image macros with little effort.</li> <li>It is very unlikely for someone with significantly opposite political opinion to ever see your account. Note, that the vast majority of the instances you can interact with have rules against hate speech, and instances that don't are often suspended.</li> <li>Certain people's attacks of political figures often involve discriminatory rhetorics. Notably, sexist and ableist languages are sometimes used. This falls under discrimination.</li> <li>Certain people's fixation of political figures has been projected onto others who rightfully challenged their opinions, by attacking the commenter and engaging in ad hominem. In extreme cases, some actively seek to annoy those with what they deem as the opposite political opinion. This falls under harassment.</li> </ul> <p>I encourage you to share your actual experiences, discuss policies, and propose ways to improve people's lives, not making politics a matter of sport rivalries.
