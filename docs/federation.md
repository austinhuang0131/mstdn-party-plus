# Information for Other Federating Instances

I am willing to resolve moderation concerns to ensure healthy federation. With that said, hereby I ask the administrators and moderators of other instances to observe the following:

* I may not see things if they are not reported *in detail*. See top warning box in [Rules](rules.md).
* You are welcome to inquire about reports and moderation decisions. I will answer the inquiries to the best of my ability, within reasonable limits (that is, I will not reveal anything that is potentially personal including, most notably, the accounts/instances that submitted reports, unless the reports themselves are abusive).
* If you are considering to limit/suspend either instance, please contact me. Usually there is a misunderstanding and it can be resolved.
    * I do actively try to resolve limits/suspensions by other instances and have succeeded in doing so. However, I am well aware with the incident regarding `qoto.org` and I will not push you in doing so.
    * During early 2023 there was a staffing issue on both instances; this is resolved by my appointment as administrator in April 2023, and the report backlog has been dealt with by then.
