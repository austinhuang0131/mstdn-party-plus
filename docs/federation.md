# Information for Other Federating Instances

I am willing to resolve moderation concerns to ensure healthy federation. With that said, hereby I ask the administrators and moderators of other instances to observe the following:

* I may not see things if they are not reported *in detail*. See top warning box in [Rules](rules.md).
* While the instances are open registration, there are various spam filters in place. I also check registrations frequently to remove any accounts not caught by the filters.
* You are welcome to inquire about reports and moderation decisions. I will answer the inquiries to the best of my ability, within reasonable limits (that is, I will not reveal anything that is potentially personal including, most notably, the accounts/instances that submitted reports, unless the reports themselves are abusive).
* If you are considering to limit/suspend either instance, please contact me. Usually there is a misunderstanding and it can be resolved. You should read [this](misc.md#blocks-that-we-receive), **especially if you're applying a compiled blocklist!***
