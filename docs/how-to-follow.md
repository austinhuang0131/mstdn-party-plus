# How to follow people and content?

Search liberally. You can follow users *and* hashtags so that content shows up in your home timeline.

You can also follow aggregators from...

* [Newsmast Community Feeds](https://newsmast.community/about): each account boost posts matching a specific set of hashtags across a variety of instances. This is probably the closest equivalent to Bluesky feeds.
* [Guppe groups](http://a.gup.pe/): groups that boost posts that pings the group account. Handles are `@{group_name}@a.gup.pe`.
    * [ovo.st](http://ovo.st/): the equivalent for the Chinese diaspora. Handles are `@{group_name}@ovo.st`.

and/or users from...

* External user directories, such as [Trunk](https://communitywiki.org/trunk), [Fedi.directory](https://fedi.directory), and [fediverse.info](https://fediverse.info/explore/people).

...and simply copy the appropriate handle into the search box to follow it.

If you're not sure about your interests, `#introduction` is a good starting point.

## But there aren't that many posts on the hashtag I want!

Try searching the same hashtag on another homeserver, like mastodon.social, or one specific to that interest.

You can always interact with remote posts by copying the appropriate handle or post URL into the search box. There are also browser addons that facilitate the process, like [Mastodon: Simplified Federation](https://github.com/rugk/mastodon-simplified-federation).
