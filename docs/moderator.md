# Moderator Information

!!! note

    This is a **draft** pending approval by Jonah.

## Eligibility

In summary, you must:

* Be an active user, for at least 6 months, of either mstdn.party or mstdn.plus;
* Be of age of majority (at least 18);
* Not be a bot account;
* Not be a commercial entity (sole proprietors reflecting personal interests are excluded);
* Uphold instance rules and the values of the fediverse;
* Have no significant moderation infractions.

Additional considerations will be given for:

* Cultural and lingual diversity;
* Diversity in topics; and
* *Political interestingness*, that is, engaging in more thoughtful discussions and not just feelings to current events.

Any moderator can choose to moderate both mstdn.party and mstdn.plus should they wish, there are no additional requirements.

Moderators may resign at any time. Moderators can also be dismissed due to inactivity, wrongdoing, or reputational concerns.

## Responsibility

The responsibilities are:

* Adjudicating on reports;
* Reviewing newly-registered accounts (esp. removing SEO accounts);
* Reviewing federating instances (esp. maintaining federation blocklists);
* Maintaining good relations with users and moderators of other well-behaving federating instances and, by extension, the image of our instances;
* Welcoming new users and aiding them in using our instances; and
* Engaging in policy discussions, should rule changes are warranted.

All moderators must engage in some combination of the above responsibilities.

You are required to:

* Recognize that the instances' role of general service providers, and as good neighbours on the fediverse, require reasonable limits of user behaviour, aligned with good values, even if they're not explicitly stated in the rules; and
* Engage in collective decision-making, notably to consult with peers, within and outside of the instances, should there be doubts. Any decisions that could significantly impact large number of users must be discussed with me, who will hold a public commenting period.

## Operation

Severity of moderation action should depend on severity of the infraction and the nature of the account.

Appeals should be discussed among all moderators, myself included.

Moderators can read [Moderation at Hachyderm](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/moderation/) to get a sense of community expectations. While it is not strictly our policy (and Hachyderm is not without controversies), it does fairly describe the spirit of moderating on Mastodon, and remember, you are required to make the instances good neighbours on the fediverse!

## Selection Process

1. Apply. (TODO: form)
2. Once Jonah and I have reviewed the applications, a list of preferred candidates will be published, and a public commenting period will be held for 7 days.
3. The comments will be reviewed and the moderators will be confirmed.
