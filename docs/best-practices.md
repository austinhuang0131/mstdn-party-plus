# Best Practices

To improve everyone's experience on the fediverse, I ask you to consider the following. Note that they are not rules and will not result in moderation decisions more severe than a warning (unless in cases where they overlap with the rules), but following various advice below will likely improve how others view your account.

## Politics

The instance respects free speech [within reasonable, well-established limits](rules.md). However, I still want to dissuade those from constantly repeating political headlines, specifically the perceived wrongs of certain political figures or geopolitical forces, with little substance. In particular:

* I intentionally omitted the word "discuss." Many are not encouraging discussions, but exporting outrage to make them and their followers feel good. In some cases, accounts simply post image macros with little effort.
* It is very unlikely for someone with significantly opposite political opinion to ever see your account. Note, that the vast majority of the instances you can interact with have rules against hate speech, and instances that don't are often suspended.
* Certain people's attacks of political figures often involve discriminatory rhetorics. Notably, sexist and ableist languages are sometimes used. **This is [punishable](rules.md#no-discrimination).**
* Certain people's fixation of political figures has been projected onto others who rightfully challenged their opinions, by attacking the commenter and engaging in ad hominem. In extreme cases, some actively seek to annoy those with what they deem as the opposite political opinion. **This is [harassment, and thus punishable](rules.md#no-harassment).**

I encourage you to share your actual experiences, discuss policies, and propose ways to improve people's lives, not [making politics a matter of sport rivalries](https://news.ku.edu/2015/04/13/study-most-partisans-treat-politics-sports-rivalries-instead-focusing-issues). Please remember that many people are here to escape Twitter even before Elon Musk happened, and making the fediverse another Twitter is against the best interest of the community.

## "Reply guy"

!!! info

    Some references are borrowed from [here](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/2023/07/04/notes-on-mastodon.html); I recommend you to read through it.

!!! warning

    ActivityPub's decentralized nature requires you to open a post in its original instance in order to see all the replies of the post. On the web UI, it's called "open original page."

Combining the two definitions on [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reply_guy), I get

> Any person who leaves frequent, unsolicited, and often inappropriate replies on someone's social media posts.

The terms are quite subjective and thus it is not a workable definition for moderation purposes, but it is clear that this is a negative experience shared by many on various social media platforms, and thus needs to be addressed.

To prevent being seen as a "reply guy," consider:

* Would your reply really be helpful to them? Would your reply really be seen as helpful to them by a neutral third party? Are you really acting in good faith? (See also [rule on harassment](rules.md#no-harassment).)
* Check out the other replies of the post. Have the question already been answered?
* Check out the other posts of the author. Do you really know more than them?
* Have some humility. Do not assume that your opinion is superior to others.

## Content Warning

While content warning is a useful feature to ensure personal well-being, discussions regarding what posts require content warning have been extremely fraught to the point that it actually drove people out of the fediverse. An overly-broad CW policy may also harm, rather than benefit, marginalized communities (whose entire experience can be considered "politics"). As such, we believe that it is best that we do not police it beyond the universal NSFW content. However, I ask you to:

1. Consider your target audience, and respect their norms (instance about page is a good starting point);
2. Mention hashtags or keywords in the post so that people can [filter](https://fedi.tips/filtering-your-timeline-to-hide-posts-on-mastodon/) them without muting your entire account;
3. Explicitly, and respectfully, seek feedback from your actual audience.

## Alternative text

!!! tip

    See [here](https://disabledsocial.github.io/Disabled-Social-Blog/posts/guides/howtoalttext/) for how to add alt text onto attachments.

Alternative text is expected to give a description of a picture or a video to someone who may not be able to see or hear everything. It should **not** be a reiteration of your post content.

Alt text is not just essential for screen readers used by people with disabilities, but sometimes even one without may struggle to understand what to focus on. Also, adding alt text lets you reconsider whether writing the post is necessary.

## Tips for Exposure

!!! note

    Your bio is searchable if you have opted into the user directory, but hashtags don't particularly improve your profile's exposure. Note that certain platforms (such as bots that read `#nobot` hashtags, as well as [fediverse.info](https://fediverse.info/explore/people)) do make use of hashtags in bio.

If you want to have more people discover your account, consider the following:

* There are toggleable settings in Preferences => Public Profile => Privacy & Reach.
* Outside of Mastodon itself, there are public user directories like [Trunk](https://communitywiki.org/trunk) or [fediverse.info](https://fediverse.info/explore/people).
* Use hashtags to allow people to better find your post (but please be mindful and not use hashtags excessively; also, for accessibility purposes, please use [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for hashtagging phrases).
* Follow relevant hashtags and interact with other users.
* Consider writing a [public](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/posting/#privacy) introduction post, indicating your interests in hashtags. Remember to include `#introduction` and pin the post as well!
