# Welcome!

My name is [Austin Huang](https://austinhuang.me) and I perform moderation for both instances on behalf of [Fediverse Communications LLC](https://fediverse.us/).

This guide serves as information for prospective and current users on mstdn.party (aka. "Mastodon Party") and mstdn.plus (aka. "MSTDN+"). Currently there are two sections. One serve as a general introduction to the fediverse, and the other contains various information specific to the two instances.

This is a working document and may be amended at any time without notice.

!!! note

    Please consider [donating to the instances](https://opencollective.com/mstdnparty)!

!!! tip

    mstdn.party and mstdn.plus are generalist instances. Therefore, the majority of the content not specific to the two instances (especially regarding best practices) should apply to users on most other generalist instances as well. You are free to share this guide to other users as long as they are aware that the guide makes no representation of other instance's rules and moderation (however similar they may be).
