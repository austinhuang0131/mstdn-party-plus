# Miscellaneous Information for Local Users

## Staff

Since April 2023, I moderate on a day-to-day basis, while Jonah does the rest (including technicals, finance, etc.). Generally I perform moderation independently (there are no other moderators), though occasionally I do ask him to weigh in on things.

I do consult third parties on moderation matters, but I do not and will not reveal the identity of the reporter (unless the reports themselves are abusive).

## Federation blocks

Please note that I use the word "block" for all instance-specific restrictions, including both suspensions and limit.

### Blocks that we apply

!!! note

    [mstdn.party suspends Twitter bridges.](rules.md#no-twitter-bridges)

!!! note

    mstdn.party only: Instances that were subjected to the spam wave in mid-February 2024 are limited. They are appealable on admin demand or community confirmation of resolution.

Most of the blocks were sourced from Oliphant Tier 0 during mid-2023. Some manual inspection was done, so the lists were not blindly imported. However, note that I did not perform all the blocks; a minority of them was done by Jonah.

I do not *actively* search for instances to block. However, if a problematic instance is brought to my attention through a report or through someone I interact with in the community, then I will act upon it.

I am willing to re-evaluate blocks; please contact me with *a good reason*.

### Blocks that we receive

Before my tenure, there was about 2 months of administrative vacuum for both instances, during which [this incident](https://weirder.earth/@RadiantEmber/109764330467479323) (referred to as (\*) in the table below; the account has been removed on the first day of my tenure) occured, which resulted in some instances defederating us. On my request, the vast majority of these defederations have been undone, however some still remain. Hereby I provide a list of non-private instances that I have attempted to contact but received either no response or inactionable responses, in order to provide transparency to local users as well as to defend against other instances that may be blindly importing blocklists.

!!! warning

    For instances that are irresponsive, you may kindly remind their admins of the matter, but attempts to harass them will be punished appropriately.

| Instance | On mstdn.party | On mstdn.plus | Note |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **cathode.church** | Limit | Limit | Response: "In line with other large general-purpose instances full of people moving directly from Twitter/FB and using it the same way, we don't really want our federated timeline full of that, or the reply-guying that often comes with it." Although the Best Practices page now (ie. after discussion) include [a section on "reply guy" behaviour](best-practices.md#reply-guy) which has been informally enforced, as I've written on that page, it is not practical to codify it as a rule. Deemed inactionable. |
| **colorid.es** | Limit? | Suspend | Asks for politics to be under CW and images to be credited. Deemed inactionable under current circumstances; for CW see [here](best-practices.md#content-warning). I accept their reasoning (in fact I strongly suggest you to take their advice), but their participation in The Bad Space means their precise reasoning will very likely be overlooked, hence it is noted here. Downgraded to a limit somewhen in January 2024 without notice. |
| disabled.social | Limit | | Sent a report regarding (\*) back in February 2023. Admin email & account contacted; irresponsive. Contacted a staff member personally who claimed that most of their staff weren't available back in January 2024; no response thereafter. |
| freethought.online | Suspend | | Sent a report regarding (\*) back in February 2023. Admin email & account contacted; irresponsive. |
| vis.social | Limit | | Admin asked about NSFW content on local timeline (which are not against the rules); no response thereafter. |
| weirder.earth | Suspend | Suspend | Likely due to (\*). Response: "we [...] have come to the conclusion that our moderation policies are incompatible. This is not somethign [sic.] we will elaborate on further." Inactionable. |
