# Miscellaneous Information for Local Users

## Staff

Since April 2023, I moderate on a day-to-day basis, while Jonah does the rest (including technicals, finance, etc.). Generally I perform moderation independently (there are no other moderators), though occasionally I do ask him to weigh in on things.

I do consult third parties on moderation matters, but I do not and will not reveal the identity of the reporter (unless the reports themselves are abusive).

## Federation blocks

Please note that I use the word "block" for all instance-specific restrictions, including both suspensions and limit.

### Blocks that we apply

!!! note

    [mstdn.party suspends Twitter bridges.](rules.md#no-twitter-bridges)

Most of the blocks were sourced from some reputable blocklists during mid-2023. Some manual inspection was done, so the lists were not blindly imported. However, note that I did not perform all the blocks; some were done by Jonah prior to me becoming administrator.

I do not *actively* search for instances to block. However, if a problematic instance is brought to my attention through a report or through someone I interact with in the community, then I will act upon it. In general, I am not willing to suspend instances *en masse*, as there is a necessity to preserve personal connections, and fediverse culture differs across languages.

I am willing to re-evaluate blocks; please contact me with *a good reason*.

### Blocks that we receive

Due to historical issues, some instances did apply blocks on us. Most of them involving *non-private* instances have been resolved by the end of 2023. There are very few instances that chose to continue blocking us after intervention, but I deem their reasonings valid and thus will not act further on those.

The following blocks should be noted:

* `mastodon.art` still limits mstdn.party and, despite my effort to reach out, I still have not received a response (update: one mod was reached privately and it appears that the team refuses to respond to me). The block reason itself is no longer valid; those concerns were dealt with back in mid-2023.

!!! warning

    This is provided for your reference. You may kindly remind their admins of the matter, but attempts to harass them will be dealt with appropriately.
