# Alt Text Rule Proposal

The administration seeks to implement a new rule mandating the use of alternative text (aka. "image descriptions") on posts. The current proposed wording is:

!!! note ""

    Use of alt text, in good faith, is required for any public post that contains media.

By "in good faith" it means that the alt text should be *intended* to accurately describe the image; in other words, one may not "cheat" the rule by putting irrelevant content as alt text (for example: text solely intended for SEO, file names, etc.). The rule is not intended to introduce an explicit criteria on the quality of the alt text, though good practices are to be recommended.

The rule does not apply to posts with follower-only or mention-only visibilities. The rule is not to be actively enforced on replies, except those intended to reach a wider audience than solely the addressed.

Exceptions to the rule can be considered in situations where compliance can be especially difficult, eg. in case of disability. The administration will try to infer those exceptions, but it may be necessary to declare them explicitly.

## Examples

(To be determined.)

## Motivation

The rule is intended to:

* encourage taking more time before posting which, as a consequence, discourages slush content ([especially those related to US partisan politics](best-practices.md#politics)) intended to evoke immediate reaction and not critical thinking;
* encourage users to think about accessibility, specifically to allow all users to be able to understand the meaning conveyed in a post (be it through screen reader or additional context);
* promote readers' freedom, since alt texts are considered post content and is indexed for searching (if user has [opted in](https://fedi.tips/how-do-i-opt-into-or-out-of-full-text-search-on-mastodon/)) and [filtering](https://fedi.tips/filtering-your-timeline-to-hide-posts-on-mastodon/), which may help authors reach their intended audience;
* discourage mirroring accounts on other platform, as well as SEO usage.
