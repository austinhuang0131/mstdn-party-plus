# Alt Text Rule Proposal

The administration seeks to implement a new rule mandating the use of alternative text (aka. "image descriptions") on posts. The current proposed wording is:

!!! note ""

    In general, the use of alt text, in good faith, is required for any public post that contains media.

By "in good faith" it means that the alt text should be *intended* to accurately describe the image; in other words, one may not "cheat" the rule by putting irrelevant content as alt text (for example: text solely intended for SEO, file names, etc.). The rule is not intended to introduce an explicit criteria on the quality of the alt text, though good practices are to be recommended.

If the post content already describes the image, or if the image is a textual reiteration of parts of the post content (eg. it simply reiterates the title of the addressed subject), then the use of alt text is optional.

The rule does not apply to posts with follower-only or mention-only visibilities. The rule is not to be actively enforced on replies, except those intended to reach a wider audience than solely the addressed.

Exceptions to the rule can be considered in situations where compliance may introduce an undue burden, eg. in case of disability. The administration will try to infer those exceptions, but it may be necessary to declare them explicitly.

Generally, the enforcement would be dependent on the post's intended reach; that is, personal ramblings is unlikely to be as actively enforced as opinions on popular subjects, for example.

## Recommendations

!!! tip

    For example, in [this post](https://mstdn.party/@benbloodworth/112044379936996494), the content is

    > New neighbors are moving in.

    whose first image accompagnies the following alt text:

    > A male eastern bluebird perched on the roof of a bluebird house with a piece of straw in his mouth.

    Not only the alt text accurately describes the image, it also gives enough context to people even without seeing the image: the "new neighbours" refer to Eastern bluebirds, and bringing straws to a bluebird house would be "moving in." 

See [Alt Text Hall of Fame](https://alttexthalloffame.org/en/) for advanced examples.

## Motivation

The rule is intended to:

* encourage taking more time before posting which, as a consequence, discourages slush content ([especially those related to US partisan politics](best-practices.md#politics)) intended to evoke immediate reaction and not critical thinking;
* encourage users to think about accessibility, specifically to allow all users to be able to understand the meaning conveyed in a post (be it through screen reader or additional context);
* promote readers' freedom, since alt texts are considered post content and is indexed for searching (if user has [opted in](https://fedi.tips/how-do-i-opt-into-or-out-of-full-text-search-on-mastodon/)) and [filtering](https://fedi.tips/filtering-your-timeline-to-hide-posts-on-mastodon/), which may help authors reach their intended audience;
* discourage mirroring accounts on other platform, as well as SEO usage.

## Implementation Timeline

After the end of consultation, the rule will be implemented in the following timeline:

* The rule will be announced and added to the ruleset.
* 1 week after the above, reminders (in the form of moderation warnings) will be sent out for non-compliance.
* 2 weeks after the above, unjustified explicit refusal to comply will result in account limits.

本站近期计划出台一项新规：发送带有图像或视频的公开帖子，须使用替代文本（又称图像描述）来描述图片内容。

请注意，本规则的意义不在于制定一个标准。管理员在意的是替代文本的目的，而不是写得有多好。
